# MetaTrader 4 Bridge

- Install Metatrader 4: https://www.liteforex.com/downloads/mt4/

This projects create a request/reply communication layer between [MetaTrader 4](https://www.metatrader4.com/) and your application.

The communication is currently exchanged with [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) (this could be extended to support more protocols in the future).

A message parser is implemented to make message interpretation task easier to handle.

Parsed messages create bindings for account info, accounts orders and orders management.

## Libraries

* [node-mt4-zmq-bridge](https://github.com/bonnevoyager/node-mt4-zmq-bridge) node.js library.

## Installation

This projects depend on [mql-zmq](https://github.com/dingmaotu/mql-zmq). Install it first.

Then copy MetaTrader4Bridge.mq4 from this projects to Experts folder and compile it in MetaEditor.

Enable Auto Trading in your MetaTrader 4 client application.

## Usage

Add MetaTrader4Bridge Expert Advisor to your chart.

Enable "Allow live trading" and "Allow DLL imports" in Common tab.

Then configure the server in Inputs tab for your needs.

### Two servers

There are two servers which should start along with Expert Advisor. First is REP server and second is PUSH server. The client should subscribe to those servers as REQ and PULL (respectively).

REP server serves the purpose of accepting the messages.

PUSH server is used to send the messages, as well as push data update events (symbol rates, account info, orders change) to the client.

## Protocol

The protocol assumes that request/response messages are strings separated with pipe `|` character ([string split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_(string_functions)#split)).

## Request

First value from request message is always an id of the request.

Second value is the id of a request type.

Request types are:

| REQUEST_TYPE                       | ID     | Description    |
| :--------------------------------- | :----- | :------------- |
| `REQUEST_PING`                     | `1`    | Ping MT4 client. |
| `REQUEST_TRADE_OPEN`               | `11`   | Create new order. |
| `REQUEST_TRADE_MODIFY`             | `12`   | Modify placed order. |
| `REQUEST_TRADE_DELETE`             | `13`   | Delete pending order. |
| `REQUEST_DELETE_ALL_PENDING_ORDERS`| `21`   | Delete all pending orders. |
| `REQUEST_CLOSE_MARKET_ORDER`       | `22`   | Close open market orders. |
| `REQUEST_CLOSE_ALL_MARKET_ORDERS`  | `23`   | Close all open market orders. |
| `REQUEST_RATES`                    | `31`   | Get current rate for the symbol. |
| `REQUEST_ACCOUNT`                  | `41`   | Get account info. |
| `REQUEST_ORDERS`                   | `51`   | Get account orders. |

Please see the [API](#api) section for detailed description and list of arguments of request types.

#### Example requests

Modify an order.

```
1|12|140602286|108.252|107.525|109.102
```

Delete pending order.

```
2|13|140602286
```

Get current rates for USDJPY.

```
2|31|USDJPY
```

## Response

First value from response message is always an id of the request.

Second value is the id of response status.

Response statuses are:

| RESPONSE_STATUS   | ID  | Description    |
| :---------------- | :-- | :------------- |
| `RESPONSE_OK`     | `0` | Response is successful. |
| `RESPONSE_FAILED` | `1` | Response has failed. |

### Success response

In case of success, rest of the values are response values.

##### Example response

```
2|0|108.926000|108.947000|USDJPY
```

First value `2` is request id. Second value `0` tells us that the response from the server is successful and rest of the message `108.926000|108.947000|USDJPY` can be parsed according to request type.

### Failure response

In case of failure, third value indicates [error code](https://book.mql4.com/appendix/errors). No more values are returned.

###### Example

```
2|1|134
```

First value `2` is request id. Second value `1` indicates that the response from the server has failed and the third value is error code of `134` which means "[Free margin is insufficient](https://book.mql4.com/appendix/errors)".

### Handling request ids

Request id should be unique with every request (e.g. incremented int).

But there are cases in which you might want to use static values, like "ACCOUNT" - which could periodically send account info to the client so it can have up to date data about the account.

## Trade operations

[Trade operations](https://docs.mql4.com/constants/tradingconstants/orderproperties) for opening market order and placing pending order requests.

Operations are:

| OPERATION_TYPE  | ID  | Description    |
| :-------------- | :-- | :------------- |
| `OP_BUY`        | `0` | Buy operation. |
| `OP_SELL`.      | `1` | Sell operation. |
| `OP_BUYLIMIT `  | `2` | Buy limit pending order. |
| `OP_SELLLIMIT ` | `3` | Sell limit pending order. |
| `OP_BUYSTOP `   | `4` | Buy stop pending order. |
| `OP_SELLSTOP `  | `5` | Sell stop pending order. |

## Unit types

Unit types for order volume management requests.

Unit types are:

| UNIT_TYPE        | ID  | Description    |
| :--------------- | :-- | :------------- |
| `UNIT_CONTRACTS` | `0` | Use contracts volume unit. |
| `UNIT_CURRENCY`  | `1` | Use currency volume unit. |

For `0` `UNIT_CONTRACTS` no additional calculations are performed, so the volume is unchanged.

For `1` `UNIT_CURRENCY` the volume specified for the trade is divided by the result price.

##### Example

Let's assume that we place two orders for `USDJPY` with volume `10` price `110` and two different unit types of `0` and `1`.

In case of order with unit `0`, then the volume will stay at `10`.

In case of order with unit `1`, then the volume of `10` will be divided by the price `110`, resulting with the final volume of ~`0.0909`.

## Price modificators

Price modificator are used to undercut or overcut the price value.

Price modificators are:

| MODIFICATOR_TYPE | Description | Example |
| :--------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| `-`              | Undercut market price by specified value. | `-5` |
| `+`              | Overcut market price by specified value. | `+10` |
| `%`              | Undercut/overcut market price by specified percentage. | `-15%`, `+20%` |

If modificator wasn't found (it's always first character in `BASE_PRICE`/`BASE_STOPLOSS`/`BASE_TAKEPROFIT` value), then it's treated as literal value.

##### Examples

Let's assume that the market price is `200` (it's irrelevant if it's bid or ask).

In case of modificator `-5`, the result price will be `195`.

In case of modificator `+10`, the result price will be `210`.

In case of modificator `-15%`, the result price will be `170`.

In case of modificator `+20%`, the result price will be `240`.

In case of literal value `250`, the result price will be `250`.
